## Backlog

1. Auto-Label by File Path

Problem: Teams want consistent labeling ("frontend", "backend", "infra", "docs") but rely on humans remembering to add them. Labels often get skipped.
Solution: When creating a PR (compare page), the extension checks which files changed and suggests/applies labels based on configured path patterns (e.g., src/api/\*_→ "backend",_.md → "docs").
Why it fits: Same compare-page injection pattern as PR Title from JIRA and Description Template — another "smart PR creation" helper.
Page: Compare/create PR page
Effort: Medium — path-to-label mapping in settings, glob matching, issues.addLabels() API
Toggle: features.autoLabel
